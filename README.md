# Rustbik

*Rustbik* is a simple Rust library I am writing. The reasons I began this project are three:

- I am trying to learn Rust

- I love Rubiks cubes

- I wasn't working on any project

And, before you ask: yes. I could have write something in a better way. The reason why I didn't might be one of the following:

- I am a beginner Rustacean: maybe I didn't know it was possibile

- I preferred to write certain things on a strange way on purpose

- I am stupid.
